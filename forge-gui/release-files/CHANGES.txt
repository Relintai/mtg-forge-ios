- Mobile Forge: Partner Commander support -
It is now possible to set partner commanders through the user interface in mobile Forge, both in Constructed EDH and in Planar Conquest. When you have a commander that can be a legal partner to your current commander, you will have a new option "Set as Partner Commander" available to you in the dropdown menu that you get when you tap the card.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
