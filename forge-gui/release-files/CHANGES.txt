- Ixalan Pre-Release -
All 279 cards of the Ixalan set are available in this release. These cards are brand new, so expect some issues with them, and don't hesitate to report any inconsistencies and erroneous behavior that you see.

- Emblem File Name Convention Change -
Emblem token file names have been standardized (and this is a change from the previous version): instead of having "_emblem" appended to the end of the file name, now they have "emblem_" prepended to the beginning, so that instead of gideon_ally_of_zendikar_emblem.jpg, you have emblem_gideon_ally_of_zendikar.jpg. This will require you to locally rename the emblem picture files to match this new naming scheme. You can use any of the batch renaming tools available to you to simplify this task (Advanced Renamer, Unix/Linux rename, etc.). We apologize for the inconvenience.

- Create a Puzzle -
A simple "create a puzzle" mode has been added, which presents you with a clean battlefield and allows you to use Developer Mode functions to set up the battlefield state for the puzzle. The "Dump Game State" dev mode command can then be used to save the state with a simple puzzle metadata template to a text file, which can then be hand-edited in a text editor to complete the puzzle file. Please note that you need Developer Mode to be enabled in Forge preferences for this mode to be of use. Also, very importantly, keep in mind that rule enforcement is active in this mode, so, for example, players will lose for drawing out of an empty library.

- Targeting Overlay -
The planeswalker attacker targeting arrows now use a distinct color from the blocker arrows, to make them easier to distinguish during a complex combat scenario. The default theme uses orange targeting arrows for this purpose, but they can be redefined in custom themes by editing sprite_icons.png (please consult the updated default file for details).

- Mobile Forge: Minimize on Screen Lock (option) -
A new option is available in Mobile Forge, which sends the game to background ("minimizes" it) when the screen is locked. This might help in case you are experiencing graphic issues (missing card pictures, black squares instead of font letters, etc.) after locking the screen for some time. This option is opt-in for now, and is thus off by default. This option and the fix were suggested by kevlahnota.

- Mobile Forge: Texture Filtering -
Texture filtering is now enabled by default for new Mobile Forge installations on Android. After extensive testing this mode has shown no noticeable performance downgrade on modern Android devices while offering a significantly higher quality of card rendering on the battlefield. Older installations will not be affected by this and you will still need to enable the feature manually if desired (in Forge preferences). If you are on a significantly older or low-end device and you are experiencing inadequately low game performance, please try disabling this option in case it is enabled on your installation.

- Mobile Forge: Dynamic Plane Background Art in Planechase Mode (option) -
It is now possible to make the playfield background switch to the plane art in Planechase mode on mobile Forge using the new game option that is available in mobile Forge preferences. In order for this option to work, you need to download the plane art and extract it into the "planechase" folder under the "pics" folder in your Forge cache.

- New Quest World: The Gates of Magic -
This release features a new quest world designed by Seravy, called "The Gates of Magic". It is a quest world built from all starter level sets : Starter, Portal, Portal 2 and Portal 3 Kingdoms. Includes 30 duels and 15 challenges, all fully tested.

- New Quest World: The Three Kingdoms -
This release features a new quest world designed by Xyx, called "The Three Kingdoms", based on the set Portal: Three Kingdoms and consisting of 52 duels and 13 challenges. Here's the author's description of the world:
The story of Portal Three Kingdoms retells the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, a romanticized version of events that unfolded in third and fourth century China. The set was specifically designed to introduce Magic to the Asian market and was not sold in North America. The artwork was produced entirely by Chinese artists in order to give it an authentic feel. It is arguably the strongest flavored set in all of Magic. In this world you will get to meet famous heroes, re-enact historical battles, and finally block a creature with horsemanship!

- New Quest World: Kamigawa -
This release features a new quest world designed by daitokujibiko, called "Kamigawa" and based on the block of the same name. This world contains 37 duels and 5 challenges built from all three Kamigawa sets, all tested by the author of the quest world.

- AI improvements -
The AI has learned some new tricks in this version of the game. You may witness some new, hopefully unexpected and fun twists in the behavior of your computer opponents.

- Developer Mode improvements -
The Developer Mode panel has been reorganized, many buttons were grouped by function. Several new functions have been added to make debugging and setting up game states easier: Add Card To Library/Graveyard/Exile, Repeat Last Add Card (which repeats whichever add card operation you have performed last automatically), Remove Card from the Game (which completely removes the card, leaving no trace, which may be useful if a card was added to the game by mistake). Also, the former button "Add Card to Play" was reorganized into two functions: one of them is "Add Card to Battlefield", which functions like the other Add Card to X buttons and adds the card straight to the battlefield, without placing the spell on stack first and without resolving it and firing any ETB triggers; the other is "Cast Spell/Play Land", which places the chosen spell on stack if appropriate, which then resolves and causes triggers to fire (if a land is chosen, it is played, and the ETB triggers on the land fire as well, if appropriate).

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
