- Ixalan -
All 279 cards of the newly released Ixalan set are available in Forge. We've done our best to fix the issues that you reported with the cards in the pre-release version. If you still see anything wrong with the new cards, don't hesitate to report!

- Allow Ordering Graveyard if Needed (option) -
A new option is available in Forge that makes the game offer you to order the cards as they go into graveyard if, for example, several cards are destroyed, sacrificed or milled at the same time. When enabled, this option only takes effect in case there is at least one card in at least one player's library that cares about the order of cards in graveyard (currently the following cards are marked as caring about graveyard order: Nether Shadow, Spinning Darkness, Corpse Dance, Shallow Grave, Phyrexian Furnace, Krovikan Horror, Volrath's Shapeshifter, Ashen Ghoul, Phyrexian Grimoire, Nature's Kiss, Soldevi Digger, Guiding Spirit, Barrow Ghoul, Circling Vultures, Zombie Scavengers, Necratog, Mistmoon Griffin, Bone Dancer, Bosium Strip, Alms, Death Spark). Note that this option does not affect cards that reorder the graveyard as a part of their effect (Fossil Find). If this option is disabled, then no ordering is performed for cards like Volrath's Shapeshifter and the cards go into graveyards in whatever order the game automatically determines them to do so (this is the original Forge behavior). This mechanism is not perfect yet (please report cases in which you were not allowed to order cards in the graveyard, as well as any strange behavior in corner cases, e.g. when some permanents are indestructible, etc.). This option is disabled by default.

- Desktop Forge: Personal Card Ratings in Quest Mode -
In Desktop Forge, it is now possible to assign personal ratings (from 1 star to 5 stars) to cards in Quest Mode by right clicking them and choosing the relevant context menu entry. It is then possible to filter cards by rating in both the deck editor and the quest shop, which should simplify managing bigger inventories. This patch was provided by Seravy.

- Mobile Forge: Partner Commander support -
It is now possible to set partner commanders through the user interface in mobile Forge, both in Constructed EDH and in Planar Conquest. When you have a commander that can be a legal partner to your current commander, you will have a new option "Set as Partner Commander" available to you in the dropdown menu that you get when you tap the card.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
