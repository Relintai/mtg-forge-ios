- Ixalan Pre-Release -
All 279 cards of the Ixalan set are available in this release. These cards are brand new, so expect some issues with them, and don't hesitate to report any inconsistencies and erroneous behavior that you see.

- Emblem File Name Convention Change -
Emblem token file names have been standardized (and this is a change from the previous version): instead of having "_emblem" appended to the end of the file name, now they have "emblem_" prepended to the beginning, so that instead of gideon_ally_of_zendikar_emblem.jpg, you have emblem_gideon_ally_of_zendikar.jpg. This will require you to locally rename the emblem picture files to match this new naming scheme. You can use any of the batch renaming tools available to you to simplify this task (Advanced Renamer, Unix/Linux rename, etc.). We apologize for the inconvenience.

- Create a Puzzle -
A simple "create a puzzle" mode has been added, which presents you with a clean battlefield and allows you to use Developer Mode functions to set up the battlefield state for the puzzle. The "Dump Game State" dev mode command can then be used to save the state with a simple puzzle metadata template to a text file, which can then be hand-edited in a text editor to complete the puzzle file. Please note that you need Developer Mode to be enabled in Forge preferences for this mode to be of use. Also, very importantly, keep in mind that rule enforcement is active in this mode, so, for example, players will lose for drawing out of an empty library.

- Targeting Overlay -
The planeswalker attacker targeting arrows now use a distinct color from the blocker arrows, to make them easier to distinguish during a complex combat scenario. The default theme uses orange targeting arrows for this purpose, but they can be redefined in custom themes by editing sprite_icons.png (please consult the updated default file for details).

- Mobile Forge: Minimize on Screen Lock (option) -
A new option is available in Mobile Forge, which sends the game to background ("minimizes" it) when the screen is locked. This might help in case you are experiencing graphic issues (missing card pictures, black squares instead of font letters, etc.) after locking the screen for some time. This option is opt-in for now, and is thus off by default. This option and the fix were suggested by kevlahnota.

- Mobile Forge: Texture Filtering -
Texture filtering is now enabled by default for new Mobile Forge installations on Android. After extensive testing this mode has shown no noticeable performance downgrade on modern Android devices while offering a significantly higher quality of card rendering on the battlefield. Older installations will not be affected by this and you will still need to enable the feature manually if desired (in Forge preferences). If you are on a significantly older or low-end device and you are experiencing inadequately low game performance, please try disabling this option in case it is enabled on your installation.

- Mobile Forge: Dynamic Plane Background Art in Planechase Mode (option) -
It is now possible to make the playfield background switch to the plane art in Planechase mode on mobile Forge using the new game option that is available in mobile Forge preferences. In order for this option to work, you need to download the plane art and extract it into the "planechase" folder under the "pics" folder in your Forge cache.

- New Quest World: The Gates of Magic -
This release features a new quest world designed by Seravy, called "The Gates of Magic". It is a quest world built from all starter level sets : Starter, Portal, Portal 2 and Portal 3 Kingdoms. Includes 30 duels and 15 challenges, all fully tested.

- New Quest World: The Three Kingdoms -
This release features a new quest world designed by Xyx, called "The Three Kingdoms", based on the set Portal: Three Kingdoms and consisting of 52 duels and 13 challenges. Here's the author's description of the world:
The story of Portal Three Kingdoms retells the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, a romanticized version of events that unfolded in third and fourth century China. The set was specifically designed to introduce Magic to the Asian market and was not sold in North America. The artwork was produced entirely by Chinese artists in order to give it an authentic feel. It is arguably the strongest flavored set in all of Magic. In this world you will get to meet famous heroes, re-enact historical battles, and finally block a creature with horsemanship!

- New Quest World: Kamigawa -
This release features a new quest world designed by daitokujibiko, called "Kamigawa" and based on the block of the same name. This world contains 37 duels and 5 challenges built from all three Kamigawa sets, all tested by the author of the quest world.

- AI improvements -
The AI has learned some new tricks in this version of the game. You may witness some new, hopefully unexpected and fun twists in the behavior of your computer opponents.

- Developer Mode improvements -
The Developer Mode panel has been reorganized, many buttons were grouped by function. Several new functions have been added to make debugging and setting up game states easier: Add Card To Library/Graveyard/Exile, Repeat Last Add Card (which repeats whichever add card operation you have performed last automatically), Remove Card from the Game (which completely removes the card, leaving no trace, which may be useful if a card was added to the game by mistake). Also, the former button "Add Card to Play" was reorganized into two functions: one of them is "Add Card to Battlefield", which functions like the other Add Card to X buttons and adds the card straight to the battlefield, without placing the spell on stack first and without resolving it and firing any ETB triggers; the other is "Cast Spell/Play Land", which places the chosen spell on stack if appropriate, which then resolves and causes triggers to fire (if a land is chosen, it is played, and the ETB triggers on the land fire as well, if appropriate).

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.

-------------
Known Issues:
-------------

Images for the latest sets will be available soon.

The interaction of As Foretold with split cards is implemented in a rather hacky way and could use an improvement. Ideally, MayPlay should be adding the static ability of As Foretold only to the split half that is actually castable, and to both halves if they are each individually castable via As Foretold. However, this is rather tricky to implement.

Online play is unfinished and is not fully operational. While several users have reported moderate success in getting a simple online match going, most users have experienced crashes and/or inability to start a server or connect to it. At the moment, we do not have a dedicated developer actively working on the online play feature, so we do not have an ETA as to when this feature will become finished. If you have working knowledge of Java that, you believe, is adequate to help seeing this feature through to completion, please consider offering your help in our Discord channel.

There is a known issue with the cost reduction for cards that have color-locked X in their mana cost (e.g. Drain Life, Soul Burn). Cost reduction will not apply correctly to these cards if the amount by which the cost is reduced is greater than the amount of colorless mana in the mana cost specified on the card (e.g. 1 for Drain Life, 2 for Soul Burn). Fixing this issue likely requires rewriting the way announced color-locked X is interpreted and paid (most likely it has to be represented with colorless mana shards but still locked to the colors required by the card).

Currently Improvise is implemented as a "clone" of Convoke keyword, which does not work correctly in corner cases (for example, together with an instance of Convoke or Delve). This is planned to be addressed soon.

Replacement effects that happen when a card moves from zone to zone (e.g. ETB replacement effect of Essence of the Wild; Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet replacement effect for a dying creature) need some rework to allow all of them to work in a rule-exact way without the need for special exclusions and hacks (see ReplacementHandler.java:120).

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

-------------
Installation:
-------------

The Forge archive includes a MANUAL.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.

Once the Forge archive has been decompressed you should then be able to launch Forge by using the included launcher. Launching Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file in the past caused a java heap space error. Forge's memory requirements have increased over time and the launchers increase the java heap space available to Forge. Currently you can launch Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file without a java heap space error but this is likely to change as we add in more sounds, icons, etc.

- The Mac OS application version -
We haven't been able to distribute the OS X Application version of Forge in sometime. We've recently automated our release tools, and will continue to look in the viability of creating this file now that things are autoamted.
